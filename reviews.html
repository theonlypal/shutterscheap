          <p class="review-text">Great price and service! We got shutters for our Anthem home and they're almost half the price of other quotes we received. Good quality materials that are scratch resistant and water resistant. The installation was quick and the crew cleaned up everything. Ed's been doing this for over 40 years and you can tell - he knows exactly what works best in Las Vegas.</p>
