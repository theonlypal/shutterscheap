## Frequently Asked Questions

### Pricing & Cost

**Q: What is the cheapest shutter option in Las Vegas?**
A: Poly vinyl (Polywood) plantation shutters starting at $13.88 per square foot for DIY installation are the most affordable quality shutter option. For a standard 3x5-foot window, expect $200-400 professionally installed. We offer the lowest price guarantee and will beat any competitor's quote.

**Q: How much do plantation shutters cost in Las Vegas?**
A: Plantation shutters range from $13.88/sq ft (poly vinyl DIY) to $45/sq ft (premium basswood installed). A typical Las Vegas home with 15-20 windows runs $3,000-$8,000 for poly vinyl or $6,000-$15,000 for wood. We provide free quotes with exact pricing for your specific windows.

**Q: Are plantation shutters worth the investment?**
A: Yes. Plantation shutters add 3-5% to home resale value, last 25+ years with minimal maintenance, reduce energy bills, and never need replacing like blinds or curtains. In Las Vegas's extreme climate, they provide superior insulation and UV protection.

**Q: Do you offer financing for shutters?**
A: Yes. We offer flexible financing with affordable monthly payments for qualifying customers. Contact us at (702) 528-1926 for current rates and terms. We also accept all major credit cards.

**Q: Are shutters eligible for energy tax credits?**
A: Some energy-efficient window treatments may qualify for federal energy tax credits. Our poly vinyl shutters block up to 73% of heat transfer. Ask us about which products may qualify for current tax incentives.

### Materials & Products

**Q: What type of shutters are best for Las Vegas heat?**
A: Poly vinyl (Polywood/composite) shutters are the best choice for Las Vegas. They won't warp, crack, or fade in 115°F+ temperatures. They block up to 73% of heat transfer, are 100% moisture-resistant, and come with a 25-year warranty. They're also 20-40% more affordable than wood shutters.

**Q: What is the difference between Polywood and wood shutters?**
A: Polywood (poly vinyl composite) is engineered for extreme conditions — it won't warp, crack, or fade in Las Vegas heat. It's waterproof, more affordable (20-40% less than wood), and has longer warranties. Real wood (basswood) offers natural grain beauty but can warp in desert climate. For most Las Vegas homes, Polywood is the smarter choice.

**Q: Can you install shutters on arched or specialty windows?**
A: Yes. We custom-build shutters for arched windows, circle windows, oval windows, bay windows, French doors, sliding glass doors, sidelights, and transom windows. Our measuring experts handle even the most challenging window configurations.

**Q: What is the best louver size?**
A: 3.5-inch louvers are the most popular, offering the best balance of view, light control, and modern aesthetics. 4.5-inch louvers work well for very large windows. 2.5-inch louvers suit traditional or colonial-style homes.

**Q: Do shutters block more light than blinds?**
A: Yes. Plantation shutters block significantly more light than blinds. The solid louvers and frame create a tighter seal, eliminating light gaps common with blinds. For bedrooms and home theaters, shutters provide near-blackout conditions when fully closed.

### Installation & Process

**Q: How long does shutter installation take?**
A: From order to installation, custom shutters take 3-4 weeks. The actual installation day takes 2-6 hours for an average home (10-20 windows). Most installations are completed in a single day.

**Q: How do I get a free estimate?**
A: Call (702) 528-1926 to schedule a free in-home consultation. We bring our mobile showroom to your home with samples of all materials, colors, and styles. No trip fees anywhere in the Las Vegas valley. No obligation.

**Q: What areas do you serve?**
A: We serve the entire Las Vegas valley including Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Summerlin, Green Valley, Spring Valley, Enterprise, Paradise, Anthem, Inspirada, Lake Las Vegas, Boulder City, Mountains Edge, Centennial Hills, and all surrounding communities.

### Room-Specific

**Q: Are plantation shutters good for bathrooms?**
A: Yes, but only poly vinyl (Polywood) shutters — they're 100% waterproof and won't warp from steam, humidity, or water splashes. They resist mold and mildew while providing complete privacy. We never recommend real wood shutters for bathrooms.

**Q: Are plantation shutters good for kitchens?**
A: Yes. Poly vinyl shutters are moisture-resistant, easy to wipe clean from cooking grease, and won't warp from heat or humidity. They offer precise light control and are much easier to clean than blinds with cords.

**Q: What shutters are best for bedrooms?**
A: Plantation shutters with 3.5" louvers provide near-blackout light control when fully closed. They also offer excellent insulation to keep bedrooms cool in summer and warm in winter. The tilt rod lets you adjust light without fully opening.

**Q: What about shutters for living rooms?**
A: Living rooms benefit from 3.5" or 4.5" louver plantation shutters for maximum view and light control. Bi-fold shutters work well for large picture windows. White and off-white shutters complement any interior design style.

### Maintenance & Care

**Q: How do I clean plantation shutters?**
A: Dust regularly with a microfiber cloth or duster. For deeper cleaning, wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap. Poly vinyl shutters can be cleaned with household cleaners. Unlike blinds, shutters have no cords or small slats that collect dust.

**Q: How long do plantation shutters last?**
A: Quality plantation shutters last 25+ years with minimal maintenance. Our Polywood shutters are backed by a 25-year warranty. Shutters outlast multiple sets of blinds, curtains, or shades, making them the most cost-effective long-term window treatment.

### HOA & Compliance

**Q: Are shutters HOA approved in Las Vegas?**
A: Yes. Interior plantation shutters don't require HOA approval. For exterior-facing appearance, white or off-white shutters are universally accepted by Las Vegas HOAs. We provide documentation for architectural review if needed.

**Q: Are solar screens HOA approved?**
A: Most Las Vegas HOAs approve solar screens. We can help verify your HOA's specific requirements and provide appropriate colors and styles that comply with community guidelines.

### Solar Screens

**Q: Do solar screens work in Las Vegas?**
A: Solar screens are extremely effective in Las Vegas. They block 80-90% of UV rays and solar heat before it enters your windows, reducing cooling costs by up to 25%. They're especially valuable for west and south-facing windows.

**Q: What's the difference between solar screens and window tint?**
A: Solar screens mount on the exterior and block heat before it reaches the glass. They're removable, don't void window warranties, and typically block more heat. Window tint is permanent, applied to glass, and less visible. Solar screens generally provide better ROI in Las Vegas.
