                    <h3>What is the difference between Polywood and wood shutters?</h3>
                    <p>Polywood (poly vinyl composite) shutters are engineered to handle Las Vegas's extreme 115°F+ heat without warping, cracking, or fading. They're waterproof, more affordable (20-40% less than wood), and come with longer warranties. Real wood shutters offer natural grain beauty but can warp in our dry desert climate. For most Las Vegas homes, Polywood is the smarter choice.</p>

                    <h3>What is the best louver size for shutters?</h3>
                    <p>The most popular louver size is 3.5 inches, offering the best balance of view, light control, and modern aesthetics. Larger 4.5-inch louvers work well for very large windows. Smaller 2.5-inch louvers suit traditional or colonial-style homes. Our mobile showroom lets you see all options in your own lighting.</p>

                    <p>Yes! We custom-build shutters for any window shape including arches, circles, ovals, and specialty shapes. Arched shutters can have operable or fixed louvers depending on your preference. Our measuring experts handle even the most challenging window configurations.</p>

                <h2>Room-Specific Questions</h2>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are plantation shutters good for bathrooms?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, but only poly vinyl (Polywood) shutters. They're 100% waterproof and won't warp from steam, humidity, or water splashes. They resist mold and mildew while providing complete privacy. We never recommend real wood shutters for bathrooms due to moisture concerns.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are plantation shutters good for kitchens?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, plantation shutters are excellent for kitchens. Poly vinyl shutters are moisture-resistant, easy to wipe clean from cooking grease, and won't warp from heat or humidity. They offer precise light control for task lighting and are much easier to clean than blinds with cords or fabric curtains.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do shutters block more light than blinds?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, plantation shutters block significantly more light than blinds. The solid louvers and frame create a tighter seal against the window, eliminating the light gaps common with blinds. For bedrooms and home theaters, shutters provide near-blackout conditions when fully closed.</p>

                <h2>Las Vegas Climate</h2>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do shutters help with Las Vegas heat?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Plantation shutters provide excellent insulation against Las Vegas's extreme heat. When closed, they create an air barrier that reduces heat transfer by up to 45%. Many customers report lower AC bills and more comfortable rooms after installing shutters, especially on west-facing windows.</p>

                    <h3>Do solar screens work in Las Vegas?</h3>
                    <p>Solar screens are extremely effective in Las Vegas. They block 80-90% of UV rays and solar heat before it enters your windows, reducing cooling costs by up to 25%. They're especially valuable for west and south-facing windows that get direct afternoon sun. Most HOAs approve solar screens.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between solar screens and window tint?</h3>
                    <p>Solar screens mount on the exterior and block heat before it reaches the glass. Window tint is applied directly to glass. Solar screens are removable, don't void window warranties, and typically block more heat. Window tint is permanent but less visible. Both are effective, but solar screens often provide better ROI in Las Vegas.</p>

                    <h3>How long does shutter installation take?</h3>
                    <p>From order to installation, custom shutters typically take 3-4 weeks. The actual installation day takes 2-6 hours for an average home (10-20 windows). Our installers are factory-trained and ensure perfect fit and function. We offer faster turnaround than big-box stores.</p>

                    <h3>How do I clean plantation shutters?</h3>
                    <p>Plantation shutters are easy to clean. Dust regularly with a microfiber cloth or duster. For deeper cleaning, wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap. Poly vinyl shutters can be cleaned with household cleaners. Unlike blinds, shutters have no cords or small slats that collect dust.</p>

                    <h3>How long do plantation shutters last?</h3>
                    <p>Quality plantation shutters last 25+ years with minimal maintenance. We back our Polywood shutters with a 25-year warranty covering warping, cracking, fading, and defects. Shutters outlast multiple sets of blinds, curtains, or shades, making them the most cost-effective long-term window treatment.</p>
