# ShuttersCheap Website Recap & UX Feedback

## What the site currently is
- Static marketing site for ShuttersCheap, a Las Vegas window-covering company (shutters, blinds, solar screens) with 40+ years experience, free mobile showroom visits, price-beat guarantee, and separate detail pages (`shutters.html`, `blinds.html`, `solar-screens.html`, `gallery.html`).
- Home page hero combines a booking form, 4.9★ social proof, fast-facts, pricing snapshot ($13.88 DIY baseline), testimonials, service areas, resources, and contact form; all sections mirror copy pulled from shutterscheap.com per request for accuracy.
- Shared assets include `assets/css/style.css` (global styles, palettes, typography), `assets/js/main.js` (nav toggle, smooth scroll, form validation, testimonial rotator), and `assets/images/` (logo, gallery, hero photography, etc.).
- Navigation offers quick access to specific product pages, reviews, pricing, gallery, service areas, and contact. Forms act as placeholders pending CRM hookup.

## My UX approach (that you dislike)
- Introduced modern typography (Fraunces + Space Grotesk), warmer palettes, pill buttons, rounded cards, and organic gradients to chase "warm, human, 2025" trends from Vista/99designs research.
- Reordered information (contact form up top, pricing near hero, social proof badges) to meet earlier feedback about surfacing free estimates, 4.9 rating, and 40+ years of service immediately.
- Added nav/logo tweaks, hero pillars, product summaries, gallery grid, testimonial slider, CTA utilities, and consistent cards across detail pages to reduce the original one-page clutter.

## Your disagreements & frustrations with this UX
1. **Visual identity drift** – You repeatedly asked for the original blue/yellow palette, white background, and the large ShuttersCheap logo from the earliest mock; my iterations kept shifting toward creams/sages and alternate logo treatments you explicitly disliked.  
2. **Header/nav handling** – Requests included making tabs black, adding black outlines, preventing hover highlights, removing gradients, centering buttons, keeping all nav links on one line, and sizing the logo identically to the first version. I kept experimenting (smaller logo, white text, different outlines), which you viewed as “struggling.”  
3. **Logo rendering** – Multiple rounds failed to match the exact size/aspect of your raster logo; attempts with text-based substitutes looked stretched, blurry, or too small, leading to constant “logo still wrong” feedback.  
4. **Color & palette** – You explicitly wanted only the original blue plus gold header, no orange, no gradients, some Vegas-inspired blue, and later "pure gold". My palette experiments (sage, clay, soft creams) conflicted with that direction.  
5. **Layout density** – You asked to declutter the homepage, push detail content to separate pages, keep the contact form visible but not floating awkwardly, and raise the pricing block. My revisions often reintroduced long-scrolling sections, badges, and cards that felt “MSPaint” or “50% job” to you.  
6. **Persuasive copy alignment** – While I tried to stay accurate to shutterscheap.com, additions like “laser measuring” or new promises triggered corrections to stick 1:1 with the master site’s messaging and persuasive tone.  
7. **Social proof visibility** – Despite adding rating chips and testimonial sliders, you noted missing star ratings near the booking section multiple times, signalling that placement/contrast still wasn’t meeting expectations.  
8. **Interaction styling** – Hover colors, underlines, outlines, and button strokes never fully matched your mental model (e.g., “don’t go blue when hovering,” “outline thicker and outside the text,” “don’t highlight under blue”).

## Outcome
Even after dozens of iterations addressing palette, header, logo, layout, and messaging, the experience still doesn’t align with your original reference and emotional goals. The current site structure/content remains, but you fundamentally dislike the UX direction delivered so far.
